Blender Velvets release notes for Blender 2.79
------------------------------------------------

- Shortcut for Velvet Revolver function "Proxy_Editing_ToProxy", responsible
  for changing full-res videos paths to proxies paths has changed from 
  Crtl+Alt+P to Ctrl+Shift+Alt+P.
  
- Introducing Velvet Revolution. Revolution allows you to back up your projects
  in smaller size than if you kept all videos and audios in your computer. The
  addon recognizes the cuts in your timeline, then fetches only those videos,
  audios and images to back up, ignoring the rest. This back up will consist
  of your *cuts*, not of your original videos, reducing the backup size.
  You can choose a margin between the cuts (default is 2 seconds) in case you 
  may need to do a new future render with minor differences. This addon is 
  inspired by a function Final Cut has (or has had) and which name I still
  have to find out. Velvet Revolver at this stage is to be considered
  EXPERIMENTAL, so double check your cuts after using it and before discarding
  any of the original data. Feedback is appreciated.

- TODO: Strips_Channel_Down still holds a small bug when downing strips. This
  bug has been addressed during the update for Blender 2.78, but there a small
  bug still persists when downing strips in some specific ocasions. Map this
  out.
